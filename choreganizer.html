        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">Discovering a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          We explored the environment around us and discovered a commonality
          among our group members and audience, and that is most of us are
          college students and share a living space with others. After noticing
          that college students experience roommate struggles related to
          cleanliness, we developed our problem statement: College student
          households may find it difficult to have consistency in the completion
          of chores around the house due to the neglect of chores and lack of
          responsibility; ultimately, leading to stress and discord among
          roommates.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="detail-section">
        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          When we had recognized our problem we wanted to solved, we explored
          how others have tried to solve it before. We found some consistencies
          and features that we believed needed to be emphasized. I had noticed a
          lot of desirable features in the Spotless app while finding that it
          lacked some basic customization that would improve the user
          experience.

        <p>
          To further understand how this application could be useful in a
          college student household, I created a storyboard that highlights a
          common roommate concern of one pulling more than their own weight with
          chores, and how the Choreganizer can help distribute house tasks more
          evenly.

        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">User Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Our team created a user survey to understand the current living and
          housemate situations of college students, and it was distributed among
          our peers. The user survey provided insight on the communication
          levels and current chore assigning methods of the students, which then
          led to the students providing their suggestions and favor toward
          particular features. The scale was from 1 to 5, 1 being "strongly
          disagree" and 5 being "strongly agree."
        </p>
        <!-- graph images -->
        <div class="row justify-content-evenly" id="graphs">

            alt="Bar graph of survey answers of if you and your roommates have a chore schedule on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree. 9 people strongly disagree, 7 slightly disagree, 13 are neutral, 4 slightly agree, and 3 strongly agree."
          />
          <img

            src="media/Graph 2.svg"
            alt="Bar graph of survey answers of if you and your roommates communicate about chore responsibilities on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree. 5 people strongly disagree, 9 slightly disagree, 12 are neutral, 6 slightly agree, and 4 strongly agree."
          />
          <img

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The apparent takeaway from these survey results is the lack of
          communication and understanding of responsibilities in regards to
          chores amongst roommates. Our team thus made improving communication a
          priority goal for our product.

        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">Personas</h2>
        <p>
          We further explored the benefits of multiple possible features for the
          Choreganizer by applying them to two personas that were heavily
          informed by the insight from the user survey. My teammate produced the
          personas of Lloyd and Jordan to get an understanding of Choreganizer’s
          difference in usage. Both have their respective struggles with
          communication, Lloyd having little experience livng with others and
          Jordan being a busy body, and both would find Choreganizer as the
          solution to bridge that gap.

        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          Initially we sketched some low fidelity mock-ups of possible
          arrangements of our proposed features. This was my contribution to the
          low fidelity brainstorming. The left image was produced during a
          brainstorm exercise. The right image was a low fidelity sketch
          produced after having reviewed our entire teams sketches and agreeing
          on interface choices.

            alt="Six frames of sketches of possible Choreganizer interface."

        </div>
        <p>
          We had gathered from our data that the most desired of our proposed
          features are notifications & reminders, chore descriptions, chore
          transfer, zones, to-do list, chore order, and transparent chore
          assignment. Focusing on the features we want to implement, we
          consolidated aspect from all of our sketches and created a new low
          fidelity sketch to reach a presentation of the features as desired to
          elevate the user experience.

      </div>
      <div class="detail-section">
        <h2 class="josefin-sans-semibold">Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          We created a prototype that reflects the interface design that we
          outlined in our sketches. We also chose a color palette that gave a
          warm feeling and reflected our team name The Aldrich Wanderers.

        </div>
        <p>
          The notable aspects of our design are the to-do lists of each roommate
          and chore assignment features. The user can view their own chore to-do
          list and view their housemates’ as well which makes the collective
          completion of chores a collaborative effort and shared responsibility.
          The chore assignment system also promotes a collaborative process by
          allowing any member of the household to create a new task and assign
          it to another housemate and allow it to cycle through the roommate
          chore assignment order or set it as a one-time task.
